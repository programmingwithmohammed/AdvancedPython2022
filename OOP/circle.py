What is class variable?
- class variable shared by all instance of the class.

What is an instance?

- if car is a type of something you can think of instance as a specific things like my_VWW is a type of car.
- Both class and instance can have there own variables and methods.

What is self keyword?

- self is used inside the classes to refer its bound to that specific class all of its instance variables and methods.

What is method?
- class can also have a method which is a behaviour of an object.
